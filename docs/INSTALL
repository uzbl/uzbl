Packages

Uzbl is available through the package managers of Arch, Gentoo, Debian,
Ubuntu and more.  If you cannot find a package for your system you may find
a tutorial on [uzbl.org/wiki/howtos](http://www.uzbl.org/wiki/howtos)

From source
-----------
You can pull the code from git or get a tagged tarball.

	$ git clone git://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl.git
	$ cd uzbl
	[ $ git checkout origin/experimental ] # optional. see below
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

If you want to remove uzbl again, you can issue:

	$ make uninstall

Tarballs can be pulled from [github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/downloads](http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/downloads)
