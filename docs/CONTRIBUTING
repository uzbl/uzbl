### Users

Just use Uzbl, hang around in our IRC channel, try out different things and report bugs.
If you're feeling more adventurous, you can use one of the development branches and give bug
reports and suggestions straight to the developer in charge of that, so the
same problems don't occur when they get merged into the master branch.
Play around with the configs and scripts and see if you can improve things.
The wiki can be a good source of inspiration.
You may also find mistakes in our documentation.

### Developers

If you don't feel like just sending bug reports, you can dive into the
code and start hacking.
Even if you're not good at C, thanks to uzbl's 'ecosystem' of scripts there
is a lot that can be done.
However, it's usually a good idea to tell us first
what you want to do, to avoid unneeded or duplicate work.

### Clone/patch/merge workflow

1. clone the code with git.
   Either you host your git repo yourself, or use something userfriendly
   like [Github](http://www.github.com)
   If you want to use github, you basically just need to register and click
   the fork button on [Dieterbe/uzbl](http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl)
   If you're new to Git/github, have no fear:

   * [Github guides (highly recommended)](http://github.com/guides/home)
   * [Guides: Fork a project and submit your modifications](http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications)

2. Do your work, test it and push to your repo. It may be interesting to ask
   others for input on your work.  Make sure you do not develop against the
   master branch! It is meant for stable, tested code.
   All contributors develop in their experimental or other specific branches,
   which get merged into the mainline experimental, and after QA it gets merged into the main master.

3. If you think your code should be in the main uzbl code and meets all
   requirements (see below), then ask Dieter to merge it.

   * send a mail to the mailing list with subject "`Pull request: <title>`"
     with a short description of your stuff and link to your git clone and
     which branch you're talking about.
     We prefer you send us links to git clones, and not just patches.  They
     seem to be easier to merge, especially if the 'base code' has changed in the
     meanwhile.
   * If you really don't want to subscribe to the ML and only if it's a
     small change, you can email Dieter personally.
   * Please avoid sending private messages on github or asking Dieter to merge on IRC.
   * If your patch is big, if it will help a lot if you can mention
     that your code has been tested and is supported by other people.

This is a relatively easy, solid and transparent way to handle all requests in order.

### Patch/branch requirements before merging:

* patches/merges must be about one thing.  If you want to work on multiple things, create new branches.
  I allow exceptions for trivial typo fixes and such, but that's it.
  This also implies that you also need to update your tree reguraly.  Don't fall behind too much. (ie merge from Dieter)
* any change in functionality that you want merged in must also be documented.
  There is a readme and some files in the 'docs' directory who should correspond to the code base at all times.
  Update them, not only for end users but also for your fellow hackers.
* We recommend you finish your stuff first and then let Dieter know you want your stuff to be merged in, but
  we know for bigger changes this is not always feasible.  Just try to keep the merges about bigger "clean changesets".
* Your code should not introduce any compile warnings or errors.  And also,
  no regressions but that's harder to check.
* Unit tests should be written to verify bug fixes and new functionality.
That said, you can always ask us to check on your stuff or ask for advice.


### Bugreporting

Bug reports are also welcome, especially the ones that come with a patch ;-)
Before making a new ticket, check whether the bug is reported already.
If you want to report a bug and you don't know where the problem in the code
is, please supply:

* version (commit hash) (see `uzbl --version`)
* operating system
* versions of libsoup, webkit, gtk.
* output of uzbl --verbose (with http_debug set, if relevant)

### Valgrind profiling
	$ add this to Makefile header: CFLAGS=-g
	$ recompile
	$ valgrind --tool=callgrind ./uzbl ....
	$ kcachegrind callgrind.out.foo

### Memory leak checking
    valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full ./uzbl

### Debugging / backtraces

* compile with -ggdb (enabled by default on experimental tree)
* run: `gdb ./uzbl`
* `(gdb) run -c /path/to/config`
* `bt` if it segfaults to see a backtrace
* you'll find more info on the interwebs
